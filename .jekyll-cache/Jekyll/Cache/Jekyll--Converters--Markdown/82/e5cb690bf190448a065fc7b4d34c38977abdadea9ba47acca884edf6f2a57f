<p>There come times when building our apps, where we need a label to either <em>wrap</em> its text, or become a marquee in order to stop truncation of text. The latter effect is quite rare, but can be found in apps such as PayPay (Japan) while using their P2P payment system.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I needed this effect. So I built a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIScrollLabel</code> - <em>10 points for an inventive title</em> - and put it on Github. I looked back upon it today, and realised that I thoroughly overcomplicated my solution.</p>

<p>Nice right? ðŸ™Œ</p>
