I"E<p>Welcome to my blog, again! As an iOS engineer keen on experimenting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Swift</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwiftUI</code>, reading developers’ blogs has always been a way to learn from those who trudged through the wilderness before I.</p>

<p>So I thought it was time to give back, again!</p>

<p>I used to blog exclusively on <em>Medium</em>, and I have quite a few posts there which many of my fellows found useful. Contributing to open-source software is a passion of mine, however my content on <em>Medium</em> ceased to be free for all developers to access. Open-source software should not be held ransom behind a paywall. I want my posts to be accessible to all developers, so the platform became a hindrance to sharing my best learnings with the community.</p>

<p>Going forward, I will be porting all content from Medium over here. Some of my older posts are written in older versions of Swift. The code may not be <em>the Swift-iest</em> around or the cleanest, but I post it. I welcome all feedback, too! When I get going I can get into a bit of a frenzy…</p>

<p>(Though really, when is UIBezierPath or CAAnimation <em>ever</em> super tidy?)</p>
