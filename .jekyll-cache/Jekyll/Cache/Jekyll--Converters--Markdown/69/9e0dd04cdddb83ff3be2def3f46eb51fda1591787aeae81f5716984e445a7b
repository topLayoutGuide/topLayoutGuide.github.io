I"6<p>Welcome to my blog. Again. As an iOS engineer keen on experimenting with Swift and SwiftUI, reading developers’ blogs has always been a way to learn from those who trudged through the wilderness before I. So I thought it was time to give back, again!</p>

<p>There’s that word <em>again</em>, again. What do I mean by this, you ask?</p>

<p>I used to blog exclusively on <em>Medium</em>, and I have quite a few posts there which many of my fellows found useful. Contributing to open-source software is a passion of mine, however unfortunately my content on <em>Medium</em> ceased to be free for all developers to access. Open-source software should not be held ransom behind a paywall. I want my posts to be accessible to all developers. It became a hindrance to sharing my best learnings with my community.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some of my posts on Medium are using older versions of Swift. The code may not be <em>the Swift-iest</em> around or the cleanest, but I post it. I welcome all feedback, because when I get going I can get into a bit of a frenzy!</p>

<p>(Though really, when is UIBezierPath or CAAnimation <em>ever</em> super tidy?)</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">Content</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">isComingSoon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Going forward, I will backport all content from Medium, to this blog.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
