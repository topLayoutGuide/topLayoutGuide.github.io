<p>There may come a time when writing an animation on iOS, that the simple, inbuilt animation ‚Äúcurves‚Äù no longer suit your requirements. If the previous words sent you for a tailspin, read on.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with a quick lesson:</p>

<h3 id="what-are-b√©zier-curves">What Are B√©zier Curves?</h3>

<p>If we get into the specifics of it -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A B√©zier curve (pronounced [bezje]) is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields.
‚Äî <strong>Wikipedia</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However most iOS developers simply know them by name. They are;</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseIn</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseOut</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linear</code> and</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseInOut</code></li>
</ul>

<p>They are most often used with a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView.animate()</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let‚Äôs start with <em>linear</em>. If you invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView.animate(withDuration:)</code> without supplying any options, except the duration and an animation block, it will execute the animation along a linear path. That is to say, the object you are moving will go from A to B at a constant rate until the animation is finished. The path is not ‚Äúcurved‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/linear.gif" /></p>

<p>Next up, is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseIn</code>. It‚Äôs similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linear</code>, however this time the animation executes along a path which is ‚Äúcurved‚Äù at the start, and ends linearly. The object you are moving will go from A to B, starting off slowly (‚Äúeasing in‚Äù), accelerating to a constant rate, then stopping.</p>

<p>The path itself, should it be drawn or plotted, would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/curveEaseIn.gif" /></p>

<p>You get the idea. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseOut</code> is the opposite of the above, meaning that the object you‚Äôre moving will go from A to B, starting off at a constant rate, and decelerating slowly to a stop (‚Äúeasing out‚Äù). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curveEaseInOut</code> combines the two.</p>

<h3 id="but-theres-more">But, There‚Äôs More..?</h3>

<p>Oh yes, there are more. By more, I mean anything you can think of!</p>

<p>If your team‚Äôs UI/UX Designer said that the animation ‚Äúcurve‚Äù you‚Äôre using wasn‚Äôt smooth/blunt/whatever enough, what would you do? I‚Äôd hazard a bet that many of you would push back on such criticism.</p>

<p>As for me, I‚Äôm like a Dog, bent on extracting a treat from the inside of a KONG toy. I quickly found a way to make my own ‚Äúcurves‚Äù with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAAnimation</code> but it required the prolific usage of ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù in the code, and the code chunks themselves were very complex. I had to simplify.</p>

<p>If you look at the graph above, you‚Äôll see why. The curve is controlled by two ‚Äúcontrol points‚Äù. The graph above has only 1 visible control point, and it lies at the right-hand side of the orange line.</p>

<p>Loosely translated into code, the graph would read something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">controlPoint1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">CGPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.34</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.00</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">controlPoint2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">CGPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">1.00</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">1.00</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Thankfully as of iOS 10, Apple now allow us to create our own curves. Instead of being forced to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAAnimation</code>, we can use them with something called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIViewPropertyAnimator</code>.</p>

<h3 id="uiviewpropertyanimator">UIViewPropertyAnimator</h3>

<p>I got creative with my own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easeInEaseOut</code> curve:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/easeInOut.png" /></p>

<p>If we go ahead and create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> (or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>) calling it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomCurves</code> for simplicity‚Äôs sake, and define the following within it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">curveTightEaseInOut</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UITimingCurveProvider</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">UICubicTimingParameters</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nv">controlPoint1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">CGPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.89</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.38</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nv">controlPoint2</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">CGPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.61</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">static</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">curveTightAnimator</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIViewPropertyAnimator</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">UIViewPropertyAnimator</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nv">duration</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nv">timingParameters</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">curveTightEaseInOut</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can then use it in your code, the same way as you would a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView.animate()</code> as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">viewFrameAnimator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">CustomCurves</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">curveTightAnimator</span>
<span class="n">viewFrameAnimator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addAnimations</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Add animations here...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">viewFrameAnimator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addCompletion</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Something when it's done...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">viewFrameAnimator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">startAnimation</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And you know I could attach a gif with a demonstration of the above code here. But I won‚Äôt. Because you should give it a shot üòÑ</p>
