I"X<p>It’s been more than a year since my last post. In all that time, I’ve been focusing on myself, which I realised I wasn’t doing much of before. I was burnt out to a point where I didn’t even know myself. I started eating better, going to the gym, working on my skincare, and putting more of myself into my personal relationships.</p>
