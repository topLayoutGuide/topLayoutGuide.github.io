I"S<p>It’s been more than a year since my last post. In all that time, I’ve been focusing on myself, which I realised I wasn’t doing much of before. I was burnt out to a point where I didn’t even know myself. I started eating better, going to the gym, working on my skincare, and putting more of myself into my personal relationships.</p>

<p>In a pleasant, unexpected turn of events, listening to and taking care of myself led to a restimulation of my creative juices. The blog is starting again, and I’m currently working on my own app for the store, for the first time since 2016.</p>
