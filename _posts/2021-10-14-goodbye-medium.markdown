Welcome to my blog, again! As an iOS engineer keen on experimenting with `Swift` and `SwiftUI`, reading developers' blogs has always been a way to learn from those who trudged through the wilderness before I. 

So I thought it was time to give back, again!

I used to blog exclusively on *Medium*, and I have quite a few posts there which many of my fellows found useful. Contributing to open-source software is a passion of mine, however my content on *Medium* ceased to be free for all developers to access. Open-source software should not be held ransom behind a paywall. I want my posts to be accessible to all developers, so the platform became a hindrance to sharing my best learnings with the community.

Going forward, I will be porting all content from Medium over here. Some of my older posts are written in older versions of Swift. The code may not be _the Swift-iest_ around or the cleanest, but I post it. I welcome all feedback, too! When I get going I can get into a bit of a frenzy...

(Though really, when is UIBezierPath or CAAnimation _ever_ super tidy?)

{% highlight swift %}
struct Content {
  let isComingSoon = true
}
{% endhighlight %}

Stay tuned!
