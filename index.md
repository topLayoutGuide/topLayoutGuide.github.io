		<h2>2009 &ndash; 2023</h2>
		<p>In 2009, I embarked on a project to learn iOS development, and set out to bring the Metro experience to iOS. Unsatisfied with the results at the time, I shelved the project indefinitely. In 2022, with years of professional development experience under my belt, I revisited the project, and I feel that I've finally been able to do it justice. Today, I'm thrilled to share <span class="gradient-text">turntable</span> with you, and I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
