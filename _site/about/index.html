      <p>I started my first professional iOS Developer position in 2015. Before that, I was entirely self-taught, learning and hacking away in my bedroom after school.</p>

<p>One day, a colleague of mine suggested I write blog posts for the company. It was a nice “break” from programming, and it allowed me to develop my teaching skills. I thought and still do think that these are very valuable skills for a software engineer to have.</p>

<p>At the beginning, everything was hosted on Medium and it served me well for a long time. However, Medium eventually introduced a Paywall, and it affected my content. I wasn’t okay with that, so I moved everything here.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
