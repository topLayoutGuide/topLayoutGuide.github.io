      <p>It’s been more than a year since my last post. In all that time, I’ve been focusing on myself, which I realised I wasn’t doing much of before. I was burnt out to a point where I didn’t even know myself. I started eating better, going to the gym, working on my skincare, and putting more of myself into my personal relationships.</p>

<p>In a pleasant, unexpected turn of events, listening to and taking care of myself led to a restimulation of my creative juices. The blog is starting again, and I’m currently working on my own app for the store, for the first time since 2016.</p>

<p>That app—which I will be calling “turntable”—will be a total throwback to where I began in 2008. Back then, I had the idea, but lacked the overall skill to truly “do it justice.”</p>

<p>I can’t wait for all of you to see what I have waiting.</p>
