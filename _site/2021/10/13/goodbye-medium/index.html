      <p>Welcome to my blog, again! As an iOS engineer keen on experimenting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Swift</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwiftUI</code>, reading developers’ blogs has always been a way to learn from those who trudged through the wilderness before I.</p>

<p>So I thought it was time to give back!</p>

<p>I used to blog exclusively on <em>Medium</em>, and I have quite a few posts there which many of my fellows found useful. Contributing to open-source software is a passion of mine, however my content on <em>Medium</em> ceased to be free for all to access.</p>

<p>I want my posts to be accessible to all developers, and the platform became a hindrance to sharing my best learnings with the community. <em>Open-source</em> software should not be held ransom behind a paywall.</p>

<p>Going forward, I will be porting all my old content over here. Some of my older posts are written in older versions of Swift. The code may not be <em>the Swift-iest</em> or the cleanest around, but I’ll post it.</p>

<p>I welcome all feedback, too! (Though really, when is UIBezierPath or CAAnimation <em>ever</em> super tidy?)</p>

  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">isComingSoon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
